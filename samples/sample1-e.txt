Finished refactoring the notification module. It's now using the new event bus interface. Had to update a few listeners to handle the async behavior properly. Also fixed the bug where scheduled jobs were firing twice after a redeploy, turned out to be a misconfigured cron setup in the container init script. Still debating whether to drop support for the legacy XML config files. Itâ€™s a pain to maintain but one client still relies on it. Need to double-check if the metrics collector is pushing to the right Prometheus endpoint. Grafana dashboard hasn't updated since last week. Planning to review PR #214 tomorrow morning, looks straightforward but want to confirm the rollback logic. Didn't get around to testing the mobile flow yet. Probably tomorrow.
